Files:
run.sh		- builds and runs four main experiments presented (concurrently)
run_all.sh	- builds and runs all elementary CA rules (type q to quit each)
experiments	- directory with image files from experiments
rules		- directory with image files for all 256 elementary CA rules
src		- directory with source files for the ca application

Simply execute ./run.sh which performs the following:
  - builds ca application
  - runs ca application with point and uniform distribution for a rule from each of the four Wolfram Classes

Keyboard commands for ca application:
  - QUIT (Esc OR q OR end)
  - ZOOM IN (+ OR pagedown)
  - ZOOM OUT (- OR pageup)
  - PAN LEFT / RIGHT / UP / DOWN (arrow keys)
  - TOGGLE GRID (insert OR g or l)
  - RESET DISPLAY (home)
  - FINE TUNE (shift PLUS ZOOM OR PAN KEYS)

Manual application options:

Usage - ./ca [-r <rule>] [-n <neighbor radius>]
           [-s <state>] [-t <ca type>]
           [-d <initial distribution>]
           [-z <zoom>] [-c <cellsize>] [-g]

where
  - rule is a number from 0 to 255
  - radius is any number less than cellcount
  - state is the number of distinct states for totalistic CA
  - type is elementary | totalistic
  - distribution is point | uniform
  - zoom is a zoom factor of 1 to 32
  - cellsize is the number of pixels per cell
  - the -g flag is to turn off the cell grid
